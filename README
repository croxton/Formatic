Formatic is a form automation library for CodeIgniter that can generate re-usuable form controls
and associated validation logic with the minimum of fuss. Formatic is extensible via plugins:

Field options: Populates a form control with existing data (for example, from a model function)
Field types: Renders HTML and includes required assets (CSS and JS) for a custom form control
Field callbacks: Apply a custom validation routine to a form control
Display widget: Intelligent view partial for the form control value (e.g. render a Googlemap)

Form controls and validation rules are described using configuration files, and groups of fields can be
tagged for reuse throughout an application. Plugins have global configuration settings which can be
overridden at the field level. All form controls make use of individual templates (view partials) or inherit
from a default, so you can achieve precisely the markup desired for your form.

Included plugins:

* Googlemap
* TinyMCE
* Related
* Related Model
* Alternate multiselect
* Chained multiselect
* Compact multiselect
* Captcha

In addition to the above, file uploads and file validation are available out of the box.
